A big part of my life happens away from the (computer) keyboard and outside the lab.  
**Music** has always been one of my constants — I play violin, piano, guitar, and harp — sometimes just for fun and sometimes professionally. You can find a few candid videos on my [personal YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmvzD6Lu9GgDOob765hYJDA/videos), or see me perform with [Joyful Sound of Music](https://JoyfulSoundofMusicMinistry.com) on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/JSMM5/videos). In my free time, I also give music lessons at [Joy Music Studio](https://JoyMusicStudio.com), where I love to work with students of all ages — from the young to the young at heart.  I’m drawn to **reading** — especially philosophy, psychiatry, and old Russian literature — and I also love **touching grass**, especially with all the four-pawed members of my extended family.
