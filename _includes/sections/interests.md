A meaningful part of my life takes place away from the (computer) keyboard and closer to the (piano) keyboard. **Music** has long been one of my constants — I play violin, piano, guitar, and harp — sometimes just for fun and sometimes professionally. You can find a few candid videos on my [personal YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmvzD6Lu9GgDOob765hYJDA/videos), or see me perform with [Joyful Sound of Music](https://JoyfulSoundofMusicMinistry.com) on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/JSMM5/videos). In my free time, I also give music lessons at [Joy Music Studio](https://JoyMusicStudio.com), where I enjoy working with students of all ages — from the young to the young at heart.  I’m drawn to **reading** and **deep conversation** on many topics — with a recent pull toward philosophy, psychiatry, and classic Russian literature. I also love **touching grass**, especially with the four-pawed members of my extended family.
