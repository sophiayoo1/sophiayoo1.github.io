I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.princeton.edu/) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/), with an expected graduation of May 2026. I design **high-performance, Internet-native systems for network security and privacy**. My research lies at the intersection of *networks, systems, and security*, leveraging programmable data planes across hardware and software to make today's networks *safer and smarter*.
