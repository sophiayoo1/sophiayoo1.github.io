I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Princeton University, where I design **high-performance, Internet-native systems for network security and privacy**. My research bridges *networks, systems, and security*, leveraging programmable data planes across hardware and software to make today's networks safer and smarter. 

My work has been recognized with competitive funding, high-profile awards, and patents. **SmartCookie** [USENIX Security 2024] was supported by three years of *NSF GRFP* funding and is currently patent-pending; **Tango** [NSDI 2024] received the *Applied Networking Research Prize* from *IETF/IRTF* for outstanding applied networking research; and **PraxiGuard** secured the *Wallace Memorial Fellowship*, Princeton’s highest honor for graduate engineering research excellence. In addition, my 5G work [USENIX Security 2024] with Microsoft Research is patent-pending, and my efforts have been recognized with *Princeton’s Research Day Innovation & Entrepreneurial Mindset Award* and the *Pramod Subramanian ’17 Early Career Graduate Award*. 

**I am currently on the academic and research job market!** If my work resonates with you, I’d be glad to discuss opportunities or collaborations. Please feel free to reach out.
